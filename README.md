# Neural Style Painting Playground #

This is my playground for understanding the Neural Style Transfer algorithm - a fascinating way to let neural networks create art from a content and a style image.
It is based on log0's implementation on the original paper.

Work on this code is ongoing whenever there is time for it :)
